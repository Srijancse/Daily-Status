* Learned to turn on the developer mode in an Android device and to enable USB Debugging for testing the application on my mobile phone.
* Learned some basic command line Commands for compiling the code, creating an Apk file, installing it and finally running it on my Android device.
* Learned about building a UI with a layout editor by dragging widgets into a visual design editor instead of writing the layout XML.
* Got to know about the various layouts in an Android application:
    ###Linear Layout
        * It is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction, vertically or horizontally. 
    ###Relative Layout
        * It is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).
    ###List View
        * ListView is a view group that displays a list of scrollable items. The list items are automatically inserted to the list using an Adapter that pulls content from a source such as an array or database query and converts each item result into a view that's placed into the list.
    ###Grid View
        * GridView is a ViewGroup that displays items in a two-dimensional, scrollable grid.
